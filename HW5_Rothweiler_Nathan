SUMMARY

This program simulates a player playing a craps game with at most 20 wagers. A wager is when the user rolls the dice,
so the user will roll the dice 20 times or if the user ever loses all their money. Their will be two players that play,
player 1 will always bet $100 on each wager. Player 2 will bet in a different way, if Player 2 has as much money as they
started with they will bet $150, if not player 2 will bet $50. Player 1 will always roll the dice first. 


INPUT
	
	- No User Input
	
TEST CASE OUTPUT: (Text in parenthesis are user inputs)

********************************
Wager 1: Bet Is $100

Player 1 Is Rolling The Dice

The Roll Is: 2
That Is Craps! Player 1 Loses

Player 1 Current Balance: $900
Player 2 Current Balance: $1100
******************************** 
Wager 2: Bet Is $150

Player 2 Is Rolling The Dice

The Roll Is: 6
The Point Is 6, Player 2 Rolls Again

The Roll Is: 5
The Point Is 6, Player 2 Rolls Again

The Roll Is: 6
That Is The Point! Player 2 Wins!

Player 1 Current Balance: $750
Player 2 Current Balance: $1250
********************************

ASSUMPTIONS: 

	- Each player will start with $1000
	- On each wager player 1 will bet $100
	- Player 2 will bet $150 if they are above their starting balance & will bet $50 if they are below their starting balance
